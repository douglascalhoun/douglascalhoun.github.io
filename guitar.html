Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
F                           C           G
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
           F                  C         G
She says I wanna do right but not right now


You drive down to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with your rag-top down
Saying, "I wanna do right but not right now"

He puts his arm around your shoulder, like a regimental soldier
An' your mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah you wanna do right but not right now

I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Street People
E                                  A           E
Hanging out with the street people they got it now
E                                  A                     E
Hanging out with my street people drifting from town to town

Once had a job at a nursery, but they just didn't like what I grow
They called the man, he ran me off and said don't come back no more

So i, clicked with some street people, the showed me how behave
roaming back and forth, wherever we want, just trying to keep in the shade

A                                                         E
How great it is, to know who I am, and be happy where I'm at
A                              F#                  B
Some people would rather work, we need people like that

I'm glad i'm a street people, have it no other way
I'm gonna stay a street people till my dying day

Who's gonna work and let make economy grow if we all hang out in the street
Well I don't know and I don't care just as long as it aint me

Just hanging out, got nothing else to do, got any spare change buddy.

Our Town
A D A E

And you know the sun's setting fast
And just like they say, nothing good ever lasts
Well go on now, and kiss it goodbye
But hold on to your lover, 'cause your heart's bound to die
Go on now, and say goodbye to our town, to our town
Can't you see the sun setting down on our town, on our town, goodnight

Up the street beside the red neon light
That's where I met my baby on one hot summer night
He was the tender and I ordered a beer
It's been forty years and I'm still sitting here

It's here I had my babies and I had my first kiss
I've walked down Main Street on the cold morning mist
Over there is where I bought my first car
It turned over once, but then it never went far

I buried my Mama and I buried my Pa
They sleep up the street beside the pretty brick wall
I bring 'em flowers about every day
But I just gotta cry when I think what they'd say

Now I set on the porch and watch the lightning bugs fly
But I can't see too good, I got tears in my eyes
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I don't wanna go
I love you, my town, you'll always live in my soul

Hard Times, Lord
    G
Oh, I've been havin' some hard travelin', I thought you knowed.
                                      A            D
I've been facing some mighty trials, aways down the road.
G                                     C
face is grimy, backs a hurtin', can't find no place to rest my burdens,
    D                                     G
An' I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Ooh, I've been workin' in a hard rock tunnel, I thought you knowed.
I've been pourin' red hot slag way down the road.
I've been a-blastin' an' I've been firin' an' I've been pourin' the red hot iron
An' I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Oh, I've been ridin' in them box cars, I thought you knowed.
I've been train hopping, searching out work, way down the road.
coal hoppers, flat wheelers, dead enders, kicking up cinders
An' I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Oh, I've been breakin' my back harvestin', I thought you knowed.
Bakersfield, up to Chico, on down the road.
Bunchin' that wheat an' stacking that hay, only make a couple dollars a day
An' I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Oh, I've been locked in a hard time jail, I thought you knowed.
I've been layin' out a quarter year, way down the road.
The mean old judge he says to me, "That's a-ninety days for vagrancy."
An' I've been hittin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Oh, I've been walkin' that Lincoln Highway, I thought you knowed.
I've been hitchin' on the '66, way down the road.
i've a heavy load, i'm a worried man, I'm a-lookin' for a break anywhere that i can,
I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Oh, I've been lookin' for a good woman, I thought you knowed
gotta start a family, get right with God, somewhere down the road
It ain't easy, wasn't meant to be, but why'd this life have to happen to me
I've been havin' some hard times now, Lawd.

Blues Run The Game
G               C              G        C
Catch a boat to England, baby, maybe to Spain,
G        C            G             C
Wherever I have gone, wherever I've been and gone,
G        C
Wherever I have gone
    D      C              G
The blues     are all the same.

Send out for whisky, baby, send out for gin,
Me and room service, honey, me and room service, babe,
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin

When I'm not drinking, baby, you are on my mind,
When I'm not sleeping, honey, when I ain't sleeping, mama,
When I'm not sleeping
Well you know you'll find me crying.

Try another city, baby, another town,
Wherever I have gone, wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues come following down.

Living is a gamble, baby, loving's much the same,
Wherever I have played, wherever I throw them dice,
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game.

Maybe tomorrow, honey, someplace down the line,
I'll wake up older, so much older, mama,
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my trying.

Catch a boat to England, baby, maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone, wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same.

Fly Away Home
G                   G7                     C        G
Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
G                                        D7   G
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away

I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days, and then, I'll fly away
To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away


---
You and I
 C
don't you worry, there my honey
 F
we might not have any money
 Am                               F
but we've got our love to pay the bills

maybe I think you're cute and funny,
maybe I wanna do what bunnies
do with you, if you know what I mean

[Chorus]

     C                 E               F                     C
Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France
                             E
let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters
    F                 G
and teach them how to dance
          C                  E
let's get rich and build our house on a mountain
       F                   D
making everybody look like ants
            C              F  G       C
from way up there, you and I, you and I

well you might be a bit confused
and you might be a little bit bruised
but baby how we spoon like no one else
so I will help you read those books
if you will soothe my worried looks
and we will put the lonesome on the shelf

In Spite of Ourselves
C
i gotta gal, she's kinda funny,
she don't like to go out, when it's to sunny,
    F
She looks down her nose at money
    C
gets it on like the Easter Bunny
G
but she's my baby, and i'm her honey
                        C
i'm never gonna let her go

He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby, And I'm his honey
Never gonna let him go

            F
In spite of ourselves
                     C
here we are sittin' on a rainbow
            G
Against all odds
                    C
we won the big door prize
                  F
we ain't got much
                 C
in the way of money
                           G
don't need nothin' but the light
                C      G   C
dancing in your eyes

She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
She takes a lickin' but she keeps on tickin'
I'm never gonna let her go.

He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
He's sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
When payday comes, he's howlin' at the moon
But he's my baby.  I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him go

Only a Fool
A              E             F#m
Why do I keep fooling myself
                C#m
When I know you love someone else
D       E                   A    C#m  D  E7
Only a fool breaks his own heart

A         E                F#m
I pretend that I don't see
                   C#m                D
When you walk with him down the street
       E                   A    D  A  A7
Only a fool breaks his own heart

D            E
I have to admit it
     C#m                F#m
Even though you hurt me so girl
D           E
I can't forget it
   C        E
If I'm a man I'd let you go

It's no use trying to hang on
To a love already gone
Only a fool breaks his own heart

Chicken Fried
G D C G D
I like a little my chicken fried,
cold beer on a Friday night
windows down through the countryside
with the radio up
well I've seen the sunrise, see the love in my woman's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child, and know a mother's love

G D C D
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
but it`s filled with love that's grown in southern ground

Well its funny how it`s the simple things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or the car you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I`ve come to know
so if you agree, have a drink with me, raise you glasses for a toast
to a little bit of chicken fried

I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don`t have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried

A Little Help From My Friends
G              D          Am
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
          D                        G
Would you stand up and walk out in me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.

       F               C             G
I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends.
Gonna try with a little help from my friends.

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own),

No... [chorus]

Em         A
Do you need anybody
G         F      C
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.

Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you but I know its mine.

Kodachrome
             D               D7                G
When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
Em             A7             D    Em A7
It's a wonder, I can think at all
And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none
                                  D7
I can read the writing on the wall

    G B7 E
Kodachrome
    E7            Am          D
You give us those nice bright colors
                G         C
You give us the greens of summers
          A             D               G    B7 E
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day, oh yeah!
E7      Am    D
I got a Nikon camera
                 G    C
I love to take a photograph
               A       D           G   G Bm Em A A7
So Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away

If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match my sweet imagination
And everything looks worse in black and white

            G       Bm          Em
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome away [x3]

G
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome
Bm
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome
Em
Mama, don't take my Kodachrome (away)

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky,

Are also on the faces of people passing by,
        F               C            F              C
I see friends shaking hands, saying,    "How do you do?"
F                   C     Dm7            G
   They're really saying, "I  ...I love you!"

I hear babies cry, and I  ...watch them grow,
  F                 C     E7              Am
They'll learn much more    ...than we'll know,

And I ...think to myself ...what a wonderful wor - r- rld,

Some day I'll wish upon a star,

Stand By Me
C                       Am
when the night has come and the land is dark
        F           G                C
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon, should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

The Gambler
     G                          C               G
on a warm summer's evening on a train bound for nowhere,
  C                    G                C                 D
I crossed paths with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
   G                             C             G
So we took turns staring out the window at the darkness
     C           G        D               G
'til boredom overtook us, and we began to speak.

he said, "son, I've made a life out of reading people's faces
knowing what their cards was, by the way they held their eyes
so if you don't mind me saying, I can see you're out of aces
for a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice"

so I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow
then he bummed a cigarette, and asked me for a light
and the night got deathly quiet, and his faced lost all expression
he said, "if you're gonna play the game, boy, better learn to play it right"

(chorus)
you've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
know when to walk away, know when to run
you never count your money, when you're sitting at the table
there'll be time enough for counting, when the dealing's done

(key change)
A                             D         A
every gambler knows, that the secret to surviving
   D               A               D               E
is knowing what to throw away, and knowing what to keep
        A                          D              A
because every hand's a winner, and every hand's a loser
        D                 A              E           A
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speaking, he turned back toward the window
crushed out his cigarette, and faded off to sleep
and somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even
but in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep

(⟲ chorus)

Sovay
C                             G                       F
We were getting ready to be a threat, we were getting set for my accidental suicide
    C                 G                              F
the kind where nobody cries, and no one looks too surprised we must realize

that we're riding on a high of success, but we're under stress like a complicated metaphor
and a feeling like we've been here before, like we've been here before, because we've been here be-

-fore, yes you've been here before
a word washed ashore
then a word washed ashore

Am       E        F#m Gm
so vain, so vain, so  vain
Am E       F
so vain in ordinary ways

now that i'm ready to consider my next plan of attack
I think I'm gonna sack
the whole board of trustees
all those Don Quixotes with their B-17s
and I swear this time
yeah this time
they'll blow us back to the 70's
and this time
they're playin Ride of the Valkyries
with no semblance of grace or ease
and they're acting on vagaries
with their violent proclivities
and they're playing ride
Ride of the Valkyries
sovay, sovay, sovay
all along the day

Lightning Crashes
C         G                     D
lightning crashes, a new mother sighs
C            G                    D
all her apprehensions fall to the floor
C          G               D
the little angel opens her eyes
                  C
pale blue-colored eyes
            G                         D
this is the moment she's been waiting for

lightning crashes, an old woman dies
all her intentions fall to the floor
the wizened angel closes her eyes
the confusion that was hers
now belongs to the baby down the hall

C      G       D             C
oh now feel it coming back again
like the rolling thunder chasing the wind
forces pulling from the edges of the Earth again
I can feel it

lightning crashes, a new baby cries
so many questions, before thoughts even form
she scans the room with her blue-colored eyes
the confusion sets in
before the doctor even reaches the door

Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
    G              Em                   Am
I'm begging of you please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare, with flaming locks of auburn hair
with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

your smile is like a breath of spring, your voice as soft as summer rain
and i cannot compete with you, Jolene

he talks about you in his sleep, and there's nothing i can do to keep
from crying when he calls your name, Jolene

now i can easily understand, how you could easily take my man
but you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

you could have your choice of men, but i could never love again
he's the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you, for my happiness depends on you
and whatever you decide to do, Jolene

All of Us Lonely
G         Em         C       G
all of us lonely, it ain't a sin
   G              Em          C            G
to want something better then places we've been
G   Em                   C      G
the rain breaks with the coming day
D                        G            C            G
sunlight dancing in your eyes seem to say, come on in

we're all made from stardust, cast a million miles
born in an instant, spend life slowly dying
borrowed from nothing, no wonder i feel half alive
but it was worth it all just to be standing here, as you walked by

              D                          G    C
now it's a bittersweet victory
D                                                             G         C
to know the love that's passes between you to me
                  G
will never die

it's a broken-hearted world babe, you know it's true
but somehow feels better, to suffer along with you
and i know this will pass just like everything else
but it's worth it just to share this city view, bathed in sunset hue

House of the Rising Sun
      Am   C        D     F
there is a house in New Orleans
     Am       C      E
they call the Rising Sun
         Am       C       D           F
and it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    Am        E        Am
and lord, you know I'm one

my mother, she was a tailor
she sewed my new blue jeans
my father, he was a gambling man
down in New Orleans

now, the only thing a gambler needs
is a suitcase and a trunk
and the only time that he's satisfied
is when he's good and drunk

oh, mothers, won't you tell your children
not to do what I have done
spend their lives in sin and misery
In the house of the rising sun

well, there is a house in New Orleans
they call the Rising Sun
and it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
and lord, I know I'm one

You've Been a Friend to Me
( D A7 D )

       D                     G
my bark of life was drifting down
       D                     A7
the troubled sea of time
          D                      G
since first I saw your smiling face and
  D            A7       D     D7
youth was in its prime


(chorus)
      G                    D
I'll ne’er forget where’er I roam
       D                  A7
wherever you may be
       D            G
if ever I have had a friend
             D             A7       D
you've been that friend to me


misfortune used me as her child and
loved me fondly too
I would died of a broken heart
had it not been for you

I now look back upon the past
across life's troubled sea
and smile to think through all I've seen
you've been a friend to me

Slow Days of Summer
A                    D           A
slow days of summer, in this old town
E7         A             B7          E
sun goes across the sky, sometimes a car goes by
A       D          A
there's one right now

looks like a Chevy, your Chevy's blue
this Chevy's white and brown, it isn't slowing down
guess it's not you

you said you'd be here, Sunday or so
maybe by Saturday, if you could get away
you didn't know

visions of you appear, lovely and true
all of my life I see, passing by beautifully
if only you were here

Around the corner, the old dog appears
sits in the summer sun, he too wants for you to come
we wish you were here (wish you were here)

Highwayman
Am             G              F                 Am
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride,
G         F            G
Sword and pistol by my side,
Dm     Am                    G            F
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade,
Dm     Am               G               F
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade,
Am           G              F         G C
The bastards hung me in the spring of 25,
Am       F        G
But I am still alive

I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide,
Now ever, with the sea I do abide,
I sailed a schooner round the horn of Mexico,
I went aloft to furl the main sail in a blow,
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed,
But I am living still

I was a dam builder, across a canyon deep and wide,
Where steel and water did collide,
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado,
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below,
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sounds,
But I am still around,

                C           C/B        Am          G           F    C/E Dm
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around, and around...

I'll fly a starship across the universe divide,
And when I reach the other side,
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can,
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again,
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain,
But I will remain,

And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again, and again...

Far From Any Road
I: Am E Dm Am (2x)
under the heavy setting sun
her looming shadow grows
Her presence rests upon me
reaches beneath my clothes

And when she kissed my thirsty lips
My mouth it ran with blood
dripping on the cross
at the grave of my true love

II: C G Dm F Am
With pale hands she reaches for me,
as the clouds above us dance
The thorny brush embraced me
and stilled my trembling breath

I
When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats come forth
to drag away my bones

I
In the hushing dusk
Under a silver moon
together we’ll walk hand and hand
watching desert cactus bloom

II
I’ll walk with her forever
Across the silent sand
And the stars will be our eyes
And the wind…

Drunken Man

well the drunken clown’s, still hanging ‘round
but it’s plain the laughters all died down
and the tears he tried, so hard to hide, are flowing

so the sullen man, paycheck in hand
has convinced himself that he understands
I wish y’all well, but I truly must be going

Am Em (3x)

why don’t you come see me when
you realize at last that you need friend
i’ll sit and drink beside you
as you laugh and curse my name

G F C

she come by bus, across county lines
cause for her pa had sent her
because the weren’t no work, no future there
and wished her something better

she found a job, an old dive downtown
she still looked for something better
but spring turned to fall, no leads at all
so she settled in for winter

Lying on the Moon

F Fm C

I’m lying, on the, moon
my dear please, find me, soon
it’s a dark, and lonesome, place
I’m being swallowed, up
by space and i’m a, million miles, away

there’s things I, wish you, knew
though there’s nothing, that I keep from, you
it’s a quiet, starry place
but with you, my dear
I’m safe and we’re a million miles away

we're lying on the moon
It's a perfect afternoon
your spirit follows me all day
Making sure I'm okay and
We're a million miles away

Murder in the City
C, C/B, C/A, C/G,
F, G, C

darlin i’m leavin’ you tomorrow
nothing you can do, nothing you can say
cause i’ve got some business down in the city
and if it goes badly, I may be gone to stay

Am, G, C (4x)

and when I leave your arms
the things that pass through my mind are strange
no need to get over-alarmed
I’ll come home, if I can

and if I get kilt down in that city
tell my brothers, don’t go revengin’ in my name
one of us gone on from such is plenty
no need for them to go get locked away

Am, G, C
Am, G, C
Am, G, F, C,

make sure my mother knows the same
and as long as you remember, the love that we shared dear
then I can die, a happy man

Mother Don't Worry
Em  C G D

Mother don’t worry, I’ve got some money still from the job I was workin’
mother don’t worry, I’ve got some friends and a floor I can crash on
mother don’t worry, I know a place they give hot meals for nothin’
mother don’t worry, I am alive still, though pierced through and rotten

So may the sunrise take my troubles, i cannot surmount them
Lord let my soul rise up with the birds flying over the mountains

mother remember when we quarreled about my foul doings
mother remember when you told me I was no good for nothin’
mother remember when I screamed through the screen door, I’m leaving
mother remember how you turned and you didn’t say nothin’

So may the sunrise, settle grievances, too long we have held them
Lord let my soul rise up with the birds flying over the mountains

mother forgive me, for I meant not a word I was sayin’
mother forgive me, I wish it had not how it happened
mother forgive me, for our memories wasted and rotten
mother forgive me, It’s time now my spirit’s departing

So with the sunrise, mark my ending I’m finally released then
think of me always as a bird flying over the mountains

Mr Mudd and Mr Gold
Am C Dm E
(Em G Am B7)

That wicked joker Luck awoke,
and to his flat-face ranks he turned,
his lips were curling as he spoke
and his eyes like daggers burned

we’re summoned boys, by two gambling men
desperate both, for a winning play
each thinks they’ll bend us to their plan,
but we’ll make one wretched fool to pay,

preparations soon were agreed on
a simple game of five card stud
set the shifting scales of fate to motion
between a man named Gold, and a man named Mudd

now Gold the first, a wealthy bachelor,
and Mudd his counter, poorer in stature
Gold was by his own greed captured
and Mudd sought coin for to drink his life away

Well that dancing trickster stacked his choice collection
shuffled in equal curse and blessing
All obeyed but the outlaw jack of diamonds
and the aces in the sky

Now lucky sevens fell, to Mudd’s confinement
plus ten of heart, and six of spade
but Gold received greater allotment
a cabal of queens a hefty taking made

flushes fell on Gold like water
seemed each card paired and paired again
but the aces only flew through heaven
and the diamond jack called no man friend

Gold’s eyes did fill with greedy vapors
as Mudd watched his hard earned money burn
and Gold’s mind did start to count his paper
as the Joker sang for a heavenly turn

Now, three kings stepped forth to be counted
but the angels from the sky did ride
three kings marched on streets of Gold
three fireballs landed on the muddy side

Now Mudd and Gold, ran close by number
the crowd dwindled, as the hour grew late
coins seesawing across the table tumbled
as the joker gave a last spin, to the wheel of fate

the diamond family gathered, to Mudd’s mission
against Gold’s double sets of low-born twins
all matching in suit, only one was missing
as the diamond queen prayed to see her son again

now Mudd went in, and Gold did call,
and Mudd he raised, and Gold bet all
Gold plated face, drained to white
when the outlaw jack rode, Mudd’s shining night.

now here’s the reason, the story’s told
if you feel like Mudd, you’ll end up Gold
those feel lost, may end up found
so amigo lay them razors down

House Song
Am Dm / Am  Em
Am Dm / Am  Em Am

You know I just don’t know, where this dirty road is taking me
and as for the walking I never figured the reason why
so I guess I’ll keep on wandering, a whoring and a squandering,
seems a fair bit better, than just waiting ‘round to die

Once I had a Ma, short time even had a Pa
He’d drink and swear and hit and momma’d cry
she told her sister take care of me, and lit back t’ Tennessee
I guess she just got tired of waiting ‘round to die

So I grew up quick, and met a girl, at a dirty honky-tonk dive,
She cleaned me out, and double-timed me besides
lots of drugs to kill the pain, packed some booze and hopped a train,
seemed a better plan, than just waiting ‘round to die

Then I hit on a fellow said he knowed, where some easy money was
yes we robbed a man, but didn’t mean for him to die
police caught up with me, drug me back, I plead guilty
now it’s 25 to life, waiting round to die

but I got out than prison, found me a friend at last
she don’t hit or cheat, she’ll never leave me in the night
yeah her name is codeine, and she takes my burdens, soothes my pain
and the two of us happy just wait ‘round here to die

Lonesome Ornery and Mean
D G D (x3)
D C G D

On a greyhound bus,
Lord I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport and on down to New Orleans
Been driving these highways,
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome on'ry and mean

Now her hair was jet black,
And her name was Codene
Thought she was the cream of the Basin Street queens
She got tired of that smokey whine dream
Began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean

We got together, and we cashed in our sweeps.
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumbling through the streets
There's no escaping
From his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome on'ry and mean

Now I'm down in this valley,
Where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray, to the Lord of my soul
I say do Lord, do right by me
You know I'm tired of being lonesome on'ry and mean

For a While
C C F C
C G7
C C F C
G7 F
G7 F Am G7

there’s no more lonesome road to travel, than the one out to the county line
and no sadder sight than lookin’ back on a love you’ve left behind
but you'll stay with me, in my memory, a love that’s burning in my mind
so close your eyes,  I’m leaving in the morning
hold me tight, I may be out for a while

There’ll be lots along the path of life, that’ll surely be a sight to see
and i like to lean into the wind, tell myself I’m free
but your softest whispser's louder than that wind howling at me
close your eyes, I won’t leave you till the morning
hold me tight,  I’ll be gone for a while, for a while

Aw lay your head back easy love and close your cryin’ eyes
though I’ll not be here beside you, when the sun comes on the rise
you’ll hear me in every cookoo’s wail, and in the lonesome blue jay cries
close your eyes, I’ll wake you when i’m goin’
hold me tight, as this may be goodbye

but through the mountains, rivers, valleys, I’ll feel you in the air
blue butterflies, your dancing eyes, in fields of golden hair
though i’ve gone on, tell everyone, to cast aside despair
just remember me fondly in the morning
hold me tightly in your mind

May the Circle Be Unbroken
G  G7 / C G / G Em / G D7 G

when you was just a youngin
you sang songs to his glory
knelt in worship, lord be praised
now you are a grown man
does your heart still sing with glory
or have worldly things taken his place

will the circle be unbroken
by and by, by and by
is their a better home, waiting up above us
or are fire and brimstone, waiting at your grave

Do you remember
our elders round the cookfire
telling stories of his glorious deeds
now one-by-one they've passed on
and the family is parted,
will we be brought back together one day

Samuel
D / A / G / D A / G / D G / Bm G A / G Bm
Samuel was a momma's boy, but never did too good in school
got to be a certain age, started skipping class, breaking rules
streets said to prove himself, so that's what he did
they’d only meant to rob the man, how the hell'd he end up dead

George was the biggest boy, de-facto leader of their crew
he told them all to run and hide, don't breath a word, whatever you do
but when the police, came around,
George's the one that they found
his momma cried,
when he said goodbye,
he died to the world that day.

G / D G /  Bm G A / G Bm

And later the prosecutor 'd say
they could’ve sentenced death that day
they only let him rot his life away
out of kindness, i suppose

Samuel, well he copped a plea, 4 years juvenile reformatory
got a job, a GED, but never found his life, no family
and though he gave his mind to drink,
once in a while he’d still think,
about his friend still locked away
living death there all alone

and the public defender ’d say
it’s good he’d told the truth that day
better him than you anyway,
said out of  kindness, I suppose

So that’s the tale of George and Sam,
coulda been any of us, happened to be them,
we get mixed up, bumble around,
just another lost life from a forgotten town, 
So Georgie needs your prayers it’s true,
but save a few, for Samuel too.
He only did what he had to do,
and it'll haunt him to his grave.

Cold Beer
Am - C - G - F

When it feel that emotion - the one that feels like choking - I grab my best friend - and we sit by the ocean
spend my last buck on a  - bottle of whiskey - drunk, tired broken down - another orphan of history

I pick you up - take you home - sit on my couch - turn off my phone
'cause I love your taste - I love your smell - who would ever'a thought - we’d come to know each other so well
hell, I guess that means - we're meant for each other - bodies intertwined - like two jealous lovers
I really can’t find words - to express how it feels - when I feel your teeth - biting at my heals

but I do know one thing - seems to be true - wherever I go - I find myself face-to-face with you
I just can’t seem to get - my mind off of you - went to rehab once - thought that we were through
but now we're back together - with a fiery vengeance - I must have a drop - of Irish decendance

cold - cold beer - whiskey, wine, malt liquor - pass it right here
I’ll never go without you - oo - don't care what I amount t - oo.
give me cold - cold beer - double up with tequila - there's no need to fear
I could never live without you - oo - …  - …

now when I'm sitting on my stoop - feeling pretty lonely - Me and my lady's fightin’ -  so I called up the homies 
they come right 'round - from the corner grocery - They're the only fellas - who really seem to know me 
little brown bag - bottle or can -  sit and listens to my problems - 'til I can barely stand
they're part of the fam - they're part of the team - took me under their wing - when I was just a teen
and every time they come around - it always takes me back - parents shouting through the walls - sounds of fighting out back

man, it feels pretty good  - to get this off my chest - even though I hear people saying - that boy’s obsessed
Well, maybe I am!  -  Maybe they’re right! - One thing I can tell you - it was love at first sight
We just can't let each - other go now - we're too far along - to ever slow down
You’re the only one who - keeps my chin up - when you touch my lips - it feel wat wat, watwat

One for the road, fresh pop - 2, 4, why stop? -  twist , pry , screw top - TALL BOY, DOUBLESHOT

cold - cold beer - whiskey, wine, malt liquor - pass it right here
I’ll never go without you - oo - no matter what I amount t - oo.
give me cold - cold beer - line up the shots  - and I'm no longer here
I could never live without you - oo - I wouldn't even want to - oo

First Song
Em - C - G - D
We drink down the bottle
another bourbon on the rocks
in a million dollar house
in the heights of San Francisco

and our floor-to-ceiling windows
look down on the crazy homeless
sitting, howling, wet
in the park

then we descend to the valley
and the darkness of the jazz club
where the music ain't great
but it's loud

But well we end up shouting
over wailing saxophones
trying to drive good sense
out...

D - Am - G C
Just to get an
escape, our own thoughts and
voices drowned by the  -  crowd

C - G/B - C - G/B

Em - C - G - D

and it seems tonight
that the world is alive
and attuned to the sound
of our jesting, shouting, raving madness...

Every night is a feast,
all bounty, rich and sweet,
damn we'd get out if we only knew
how...

D - Am - G C
Up the freeway - ramp,
put the pedal to the floor

C - B7 - G C  G
Why - are you so eager - to leave - they'd like - to know

B7 - Am (x4)
The party's  -  lovely
but this  -  timeless need
and then - you need to flee
end and start another journey

Em C G/B Em C G/B

Dust in the Wind
  C     G  Am
I close my eyes
 G         Dm           Am
only for a moment and a moment's gone

all my dreams
pass before my eyes a curiosity

D   G        Am
dust in the wind
all we are is dust in the wind

same old song
just a drop of water in an endless sea
all we do
crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

now, don't hang on,
nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
and all your money won't another minute buy</template>
